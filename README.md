probabilistic-js
================

Turning Javascript into a probabilistic programming language, following the approach presented in [this paper](http://www.stanford.edu/~ngoodman/papers/lightweight-mcmc-aistats2011.pdf) and [this talk](http://videolectures.net/aistats2011_wingate_lightweight/).

probabilistic-js works via _source code transformation_: you write probabilistic code in `.pjs` files which are transformed into plain-old deterministic Javascript in `.js` files before being executed. For example:

	node bin/p.js [-p] ./probcode.pjs

The `-p` option, if present, will keep around the transformed `.js` code, which can be useful for debugging in some cases. Take a look at `test.pjs` for some simple examples.

Programs written in probabilistic-js can also be run in the browser via [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify). The `webppl` directory contains the framework for a simple example (using the excellent [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) widget). Just use the command:

	browserify -r ./probabilistic/index -r ./probabilistic/transform -r ./probabilistic/util > webppl/probabilistic.js

Or if you don't have browserify set up with a command alias, call it with `node node_modules/browserify/bin/cmd.js`

A running instance of this web demo can be found [here](http://dritchie.github.io/probabilistic-js).
